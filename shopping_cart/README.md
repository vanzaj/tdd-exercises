# Shopping cart

Implement a function that will calculate the total net value of items
in a shopping cart represented as a list of unit price and quantity â€“
e.g., `[[10.0, 5], [25.5, 2]]`, with the following discounts applied:

    1. If total gross value > $100, apply a 5% discount
    2. If total gross value > $200, apply a 10% discount

Change the function to a method of a `ShoppingCart` object which keeps items as an attribute.
