Rock-Paper-Scissors is a game for two players.

Each player simultaneously reveals whether they have randomly selected Rock, Paper, or Scissors.

The winner of each round is determined as follows:
  Rock blunts Scissors – Rock wins
  Scissors cuts Paper – Scissors wins
  Paper wraps Stone – Paper wins

If both players select the same, then that round is a draw.

The game consists of three rounds, but if there’s no clear winner after three, they continue playing until one of them wins.
