# 24-hour clock

The so called "24-hour clock" is used in navigation (sea, air), hospitals, airports and whereever a timetable is needed.

This kata has 2 parts:
  - 1. Humanize time and duration.
       Examples: 
         -  1.00am = 0100 -- oh one double oh
         -  8.30am = 0830 -- oh eight thirty
         - 10.43am = 1043 -- ten fourty three
         - 12.00pm = 1200 -- twelve hundred
         -  1.00pm = 1300 -- thirteen hundred 
         -  8.30pm = 2030 -- twenty thirty
  - 2. Implement addition and substraction of time and duration
       Examples:
         - 0300 + 1900 = 2200
         - 1000 - 0537 = 0423
         - 1123 - 0214 = 0909
         - 0837 + 0715 = 1552
         - 1759 + 0511 = 2310
