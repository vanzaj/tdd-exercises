# Fibonacci numbers

Calculate numbers in the Fibonacci sequence.

The Fibonacci sequence starts with 0 and 1, and then all
subsequent numbers are the sum of the previous two:
0, 1, 0+1=1, 1+1=2, 2+1=3, 3+2=5, 5+3=8, etc.

Write a function or class method that takes an index and returns corresponding Fibonacci number. Negative index should throw an error.
